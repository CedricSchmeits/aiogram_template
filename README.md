1. **_Make sure you have installed [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)._**

2. Generate project
    ```commandline
    cookiecutter https://github.com/0Kit/aiogram_template.git
    ```

3. Create an environment
    
    _Make sure you have installed [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)_
    
    ```commandline
    poetry install
    ```

    ```commandline
    poetry run alembic revision --autogenerate -m init 
    ```
6. Run project _(Choose one of the options)_
    
    **In docker container(using make)**
    
    _Make sure you have installed [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) and Make_
